# D-GCCA: Decomposition-based Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multiple High-dimensional Datasets 

This python package implements the D-GCCA method proposed in [1]. See [example.py](https://github.com/shu-hai/D-GCCA/blob/master/example.py) for details, with Python 3.

D-GCCA conducts the following decomposition of observed multiblock data $`\{Y_k\}_{k=1}^K`$:
